### Hi there 👋

🧚 I'm Sanja, a passionate front-end developer. To see more about me, please check out my portfolio website that I've created. You can find it at https://sanja-misic.github.io/My-portfolio-website/.

💁I have experience working with HTML5, CSS3, SASS and JavaScript, and am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.

📚 Currently, I'm focused on learning TypeScript and I'm excited to see how I can incorporate this new knowledge into my future projects. Once I have a solid understanding of TypeScript, my next step is to delve deeper into a JavaScript framework and continue expanding my expertise. 

🌱 i'm looking for a company that can recognize my talents and potential as a developer. If you believe that I would be a good fit for your company and share your vision for innovation and growth, please take a look at my portfolio and feel free to contact me.

🙂 Thank you for your interest!
